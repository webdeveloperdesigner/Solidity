# Hardhat Sample Project  

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It includes:  
- A sample Solidity smart contract.  
- A test suite for the contract to ensure functionality.  
- A Hardhat Ignition module for deploying the contract to a blockchain network.  

The project is designed to help you quickly get started with Hardhat, a powerful development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

## Project Features  

1. **Sample Contract**:  
   - A simple Solidity contract that demonstrates fundamental concepts.  
   - The contract can be used as a template or reference for building more complex applications.  

2. **Test Suite**:  
   - Includes basic unit tests to validate the functionality of the contract.  
   - Ensures your contract works as expected before deploying it on-chain.  

3. **Deployment Module**:  
   - A Hardhat Ignition module is included for deploying the contract.  
   - Ignition simplifies deployment workflows and configurations.
